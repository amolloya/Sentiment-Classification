# Sentiment Classification

In this section, we classify a sentence as a positive or negative sentiment using a 3-layered Neural Network in Tensorflow.

We first create a lexicon (dictionary) of all the words in our positive and negative sentiment files. Then we create the feature sets and labels for the training and testing data. </br> The code is available in the file: Sentiment_featuresets.

Then we create a neural network model and train and test the data using tensorflow. </br> The code is available in the file: Sentiment_classification.

The data is available at:
